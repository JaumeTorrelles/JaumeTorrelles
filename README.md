**``Engineering Student | Learning to Build Complex Systems from the Ground Up``**

I'm an engineering student currently pursuing a dual degree in **Computer Engineering** and **Telecommunications** at Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona (UAB). I like to learn by building, this approach allows me to understand complex systems while mastering new languages and tools along the way.

Each project is a learning exercise focused on strong foundations, clean architecture, and understanding the "why" behind the code.
